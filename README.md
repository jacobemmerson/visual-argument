## About

This project demonstrates elements of visual rhetoric such as juxtaposition and contrast. It is a commentary on the two-party politcal system in the United States which, although is not something enforced by law, is a byproduct of the current voting system and the capitalist-driven legislation. 

### Rhetoric and Tools Applied
- Juxtaposition
- Contrast
- Color to Alpha adjustments
- Contrast and Brightness adjustments
- Hue and Tone adjustments
- Alpha reductions by color

### Application of A.I. Generated Art

  - Prompt: "Front facing concrete enclosure with low ceilings"
